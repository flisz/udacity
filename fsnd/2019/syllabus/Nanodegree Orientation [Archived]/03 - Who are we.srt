0:00:00.540,0:00:02.350
Before we dive deeper[br]into this orientation,

0:00:02.350,0:00:04.490
we should probably start[br]with some introductions.

0:00:04.490,0:00:05.800
>> Hi, I'm Mike Wales,

0:00:05.800,0:00:08.570
the web development curriculum[br]manager here at Udacity.

0:00:08.570,0:00:11.790
I started out teaching myself web[br]development over 16 years ago.

0:00:11.790,0:00:14.870
I freelanced for a few years, and then[br]I went on to build web applications for

0:00:14.870,0:00:16.329
a number of Department of Defense and

0:00:16.329,0:00:18.910
government agencies,[br]prior to joining Udacity.

0:00:18.910,0:00:20.220
>> And I'm Miriam Swords Kalk.

0:00:20.220,0:00:23.110
I work on community and[br]student experience for nanodegrees.

0:00:23.110,0:00:25.910
I started out here at Udacity as[br]a course developer, helping plan and

0:00:25.910,0:00:28.830
create new courses, and then I moved[br]over to our student services team

0:00:28.830,0:00:31.040
to get more direct[br]interaction with students.

0:00:31.040,0:00:33.990
I've really loved learning to understand[br]what our students like you want and

0:00:33.990,0:00:36.890
need, and that's exactly what[br]I'm doing in this nanodegree.

0:00:36.890,0:00:40.420
I'm here to be your number one advocate,[br]your voice within our company.

0:00:40.420,0:00:43.810
I can't wait to hear the feedback you[br]have for us throughout the nanodegree.

0:00:43.810,0:00:46.370
It's not just the two of us[br]working on nanodegrees though.

0:00:46.370,0:00:49.170
You will also interact with members[br]of the Udacity coach team and

0:00:49.170,0:00:52.170
course development team frequently[br]while you're in the program.

0:00:52.170,0:00:54.490
These people have strong[br]technical backgrounds.

0:00:54.490,0:00:57.230
They're really experienced with[br]programming and web development.

0:00:57.230,0:00:58.860
>> They're also experts[br]on the projects and

0:00:58.860,0:01:01.680
courses in your nanodegree since they[br]have a lot of experience with them.

0:01:01.680,0:01:04.160
And on top of that,[br]they're professional educators.

0:01:04.160,0:01:06.070
They understand how to[br]help you learn best and

0:01:06.070,0:01:07.240
are here to help make that happen.
