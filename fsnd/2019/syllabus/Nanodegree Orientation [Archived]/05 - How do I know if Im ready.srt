But there are a few[br]important pre-requisites

0:00:05.400,0:00:07.689
that you need to make sure you've[br]met before starting this program.

The full stack web developer nanodegree[br]requires experience with HTML, CSS,

0:00:22.226,0:00:25.600
JavaScript and[br]Git-based version control as well.

you will have difficulty[br]completing the projects.

0:00:30.310,0:00:32.030
If you believe you're[br]lacking this experience,

0:00:32.030,0:00:34.709
we encourage you to check out our[br]front-end developer nanodegree.

0:00:40.200,0:00:43.660
you to start this nanodegree, you'll[br]need to commit at least ten hours a week

0:00:43.660,0:00:46.330

0:00:46.330,0:00:48.530
