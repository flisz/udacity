Welcome to Udacity's Full Stack[br]Web Developer Nanodegree.

0:00:03.560,0:00:06.400
My name is Michael Wales, I've been[br]lucky enough to be a professional web

0:00:06.400,0:00:08.490
developer for over 16 years.

0:00:08.490,0:00:10.940
It's a job that I love and[br]I'm passionate about.

0:00:10.940,0:00:14.220
I joined Udacity to help people like you[br]launch themselves into a career that is

0:00:14.220,0:00:17.610
fun, exciting and[br]in a field that is endlessly growing.

0:00:17.610,0:00:20.540
By completing Udacity's full[br]stack web developer nanodegree,

0:00:20.540,0:00:23.750
you will have the qualifications you[br]need to start or advance your career as

0:00:23.750,0:00:27.260
a professional web developer with[br]the portfolio of projects to prove it.

0:00:27.260,0:00:30.310
For example, you'll build a movie[br]website to share your favorite movie

0:00:30.310,0:00:31.730
trailers with your friends.

0:00:31.730,0:00:33.850
You'll build a database driven[br]application to store and

0:00:33.850,0:00:35.740
analyze the results of a tournament.

0:00:35.740,0:00:38.580
You'll build an item catalog website[br]that includes authentication and

0:00:38.580,0:00:40.840
allows users to update the content.

0:00:40.840,0:00:43.990
You'll build a massively scalable[br]API that powers a mobile conference

0:00:43.990,0:00:44.950
application.

0:00:44.950,0:00:48.330
And finally, you'll turn a bear[br]bones Linux server into a secure and

0:00:48.330,0:00:50.210
efficient web server[br]your applications demand.

0:00:50.210,0:00:52.670
>> With the help of[br]our industry partners,

0:00:52.670,0:00:54.840
we designed these projects[br]to showcase the skills and

0:00:54.840,0:00:59.210
technologies companies are looking for[br]when hiring full stock web developers.

0:00:59.210,0:01:02.690
Our team here at Udacity is excited to[br]help you develop the expertise you need

0:01:02.690,0:01:04.300
to build these projects.

0:01:04.300,0:01:07.200

Then once you're in the program, you'll[br]be supported by your student community

0:01:12.150,0:01:14.450
